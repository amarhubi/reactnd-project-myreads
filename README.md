# MyReads Project
Virtual library management tool.

Allows the user to put books into 3 categories: Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read. The user can search for books and add books from the online library to one of their personal shelves.

# Installation
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
